# NAME

Business::GoCardless - Perl library for interacting with the GoCardless API
(https://gocardless.com)

# VERSION

0.01

# DESCRIPTION

Business::GoCardless is a library for easy interface to the gocardless
payment service, it implements most of the functionality currently found
in the service's API documentation: https://developer.gocardless.com

Current missing functionality is partner account handling and webhooks, but
all resource manipulation (Bill, Merchant, Payout etc) is handled along with
the checking/generation of signature, nonce, param normalisation, and other
such lower level interface with the API.

Please note this library is in its early stages and is subject to change. An
attempt has been made to write it in such a way as to make this unlikely - it
borrows heavily from the official gocardless ruby library.

**You should refer to the official gocardless API documentation in conjunction**
**with this perldoc**, as the official API documentation explains in more depth
some of the functionality including required / optional parameters for certain
methods.

# SYNOPSIS

The following examples show instantiating the object and getting a resource
(Bill in this case) to manipulate. For more examples see the t/002\_end\_to\_end.t
script, which can be run against the gocardless sandbox (or even live) endpoint
when given the necessary ENV variables.

    my $GoCardless = Business::GoCardless->new(
        token           => $your_gocardless_token
        client_details  => {
            base_url    => $gocardless_url, # defaults to https://gocardless.com
            app_id      => $your_gocardless_app_id,
            app_secret  => $your_gocardless_app_secret,
            merchant_id => $your_gocardless_merchant_id,
        },
    );

    # get merchant details
    my $Merchant = $GoCardless->merchant;

    # create URL for a one off bill (https://developer.gocardless.com/#create-a-one-off-bill)
    my $new_bill_url = $GoCardless->new_bill_url(
        amount       => 100,
        name         => "Some Bill",
        description  => "Some Bill Description",
        user         => $user_hash,
        redirect_uri => "https://foo/success",
        cancel_uri   => "https://foo/cancel",
        state        => "some_state_data",
    );

    # having sent the user to the $new_bill_url and them having complete it,
    # we need to confirm the resource using the details sent by gocardless to
    # the redirect_uri (https://developer.gocardless.com/#confirm-a-new-one-off-bill)
    my $Bill = $GoCardless->confirm_resource(
        resource_uri  => $uri,
        resource_type => 'bill', # in the above case
        resource_id   => $bill_id,
        signature     => $signature,
        state         => "some_state_data",
    );

    # get a specfic Bill
    $Bill = $GoCardless->bill( $id );

    # cancel the bill
    $Bill->cancel;

    # too late? maybe we should refund instead
    $Bill->refund;

    # or maybe it failed?
    $Bill->retry if $Bill->failed;

    # get a list of Bill objects (filter optional: https://developer.gocardless.com/#filtering)
    my @bills = $GoCardless->bills( %filter );

    # on any resource object:
    my %data = $Bill->to_hash;
    my $json = $Bill->to_json;

# ERROR HANDLING

Any problems or errors will result in a Business::GoCardless::Exception
object being thrown, so you should wrap any calls to the library in the
appropriate error catching code (TryCatch in the below example):

    use TryCatch;

    try {
        my $Pager = $GoCardless->bills;

        while( my @bills = $Pager->next ) {
            foreach my $Bill ( @bills ) {
                $Bill->cancel;
            }
        }
    }
    catch ( Business::GoCardless::Exception ) {
        # error specific to Business::GoCardless
        ...
        say $e->message;  # error message
        say $e->code;     # HTTP status code
        say $e->response; # HTTP status message
    }
    catch ( $e ) {
        # some other failure?
        ...
    }

# PAGINATION

Any methods marked as **pager** have a dual interface, when called in list context
they will return the first 100 resource objects, when called in scalar context they
will return a [Business::GoCardless::Pagination](https://metacpan.org/pod/Business::GoCardless::Pagination) object allowing you to iterate
through all the objects:

    # get a list of L<Business::GoCardless::Bill> objects
    # (filter optional: https://developer.gocardless.com/#filtering)
    my @bills = $GoCardless->bills( %filter );

    # or using the Business::GoCardless::Pagination object:
    my $Pager = $GoCardless->bills;

    while( my @bills = $Pager->next ) {
        foreach my $Bill ( @bills ) {
            ...
        }
    }
